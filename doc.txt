create file index.html,style,css,main.js

index.html:
    in html file define document name and link style
    in body tag defined main tag which contain heading and container class 

    in conatiner we define game class with boxes as button
    reset button with id reset_game
 
style.css: 
    good practice to define document margin and padding as 0

    set background color and text align center for body tag 
    set container class height 

    to create box: 
        contianer height  = 70vh means 70% as contianer of document
        game height and width 60% of container
        box  = divide the height and width in 3 part i.e 18vh or 18%

        display = flex in one line and and flex-wrap = wrap which will make 3*3 box
        to make center in game class justify-content and align-items center which make it center of class of game 

        to set apce between boxes use gap property 

        and same propertywill apply to conatiner which now boxes will be at center

    reset button : style the button
                    #reset-btn{
                        padding: 1rem;
                        font-size: 1.25rem;
                        background-color: #3B1C32;
                        color: aliceblue;
                        border-radius: 1rem;
                        box-shadow: 2px 0 1rem rgba(0,0,0,0.3);
                        border: none;
                    }
app.js :
    now we have to access the button using boxes for game
    and reset button 

    now we have to track turn of the player 1 or 2
    take varible turn0 for player 1 and turn1 for player 2  and make player 1 as true


    wining patterns we will store it in 2D array 
    pattern{
        horizontal
        0,1,2
        3,4,5
        6,7,8
        vertical 
        0,3,6
        1,4,7
        2,5,8
        digonal
        0,4,8
        2,4,6
    }

    now adding event listner on boxes
    first iterate all the boxes and add event listener click and then change contain inside the box as x or O
    to disable the button


hw:
O and x should have different colors
